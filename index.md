## Research Interest

My research interests focus on public-key cryptography with provable security. 

In particular, I am interested in the design of cryptographic schemes
- immune to new types of attacks, including key-dependent message attack (KDM), related-key attack (RKA), key-leakage attack (KLA) and selective-opening attack (SOA);
- enjoying a tight security reduction to computational assumptions;
- based on the intractability of factoring-based (DCR), pairing-based (DDH, DLIN) or lattice (LWE, LPN) problems.
